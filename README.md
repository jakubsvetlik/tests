# TestCafe tests

Those are projects I am doing when learning web testing in TestCafe - Open Source Testing Framework.

## How to use these files

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Open Source using Javascript
2. Open cmd with administration rights and type: npm install -g testcafe
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Running the .js files and tests (Not required)


## Running the tests

Open visual studio code, open downloaded .js file and run this command in VSC Terminal:
```
testcafe chrome filename.js
```

Press ENTER and wait till the test is done.

### Break down into end to end tests

This web testing is used to check whether certain functions on the web are working properly, such as mouse hover, clicking on button, adding goods to basket, showing images or other certain CSS/HTML elements (example: pictures.js)
